Serial Splitting of the Dataset\nThis is described as the simplest method of splitting data.

The training set includes rows from the start up to 80% of the total count, and the test set includes the rows from that cutoff point to the end.\n\n### 2.

Usually, $X$ includes all columns except the last one, and $y$ is the last column.\n    *   **Use `train_test_split`:** Utilize the built-in method from `sklearn.cross_validation`.\n    *   **Parameters:**\n        *   `test_size = 0.2`: This specifies that 20% of the data should be allocated to the test set (leaving 80% for the training set).\n        *   `random_state = 0`: This sets a seed for the random number generator, ensuring the random splits can be reproduced.",
