It was introduced around 1965 at\nStanford by Edward Feigenbaum.\n▪ “ES is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to simulate the judgment\nand behavior of a human or an organization that has expert knowledge and experience in a\nparticular field such as medical diagnosis, account, coding, and games, etc.”\n▪ ES gathers data by asking the user questions about the problem. An initial set of questions can lead\nto further questions depending on the user’s responses.\n▪ The ES reasons what questions it needs to ask, based on the knowledge it is given. It will use the\nresponses from users to rule out various possibilities that will allow it eventually reach a decision or\ndiagnosis.\n\nWHAT IS AN EXPERT SYSTEM ?\n• We rely on expert systems to help us with knowledge and understanding in a particular field.\nWe use them the same way as certain experts in our lives.\n• For example, we will see a doctor if we have a health problem, or we will see a car mechanic\nif our car will not start.\n• We can similarly use an expert system; it will ask us questions about our health problem or\ncar problem and provide us with a diagnosis or course of action.\n• ES is designed to try and replicate the judgment of a human that has expert knowledge in a\ncertain field. By doing this they can be used to replace or assist a human expert.",

This is the knowledge that is widely shared.\n▪ The second type is heuristic knowledge. This is the knowledge that is more personal and is\nacquired through a range of experiences and reasoning.\n\nKnowledge Base\n▪ Once the knowledge base is built, it can be used by the expert system to inform the question\nsit needs to ask and assist in providing the results.\n▪ Part of the knowledge base is the rule base. The rule base is a set of rules that will be used\nto produce an output or decision by the expert system. These rules are used by the\ninference engine as a base for reasoning, to obtain a solution to a problem or a decision.\n▪ Each rule will contain two parts, the IF and the THEN. A rule can also have multiple IF parts\nthat will be joined together by Boolean operators including AND and OR.\n▪ Most ES will have a knowledge-based editor built into them.

This may\nthen lead to further questions and eventually a final result.\n▪ The inference engine is mostly a problem-solving tool. It organizes and controls steps to\nsolve the problem. To do this it often uses a chaining method. It chains together what is\nknown as IF-THEN rules to form a line of reasoning.\n▪ The IF part of the rule is a condition, for example, IF I am hungry. The Then part of the rule\nis an action, for IF I am hungry THEN I will need to eat.\n\nInference Engine\n▪ There are two main methods that can be used to obtain a result. The appropriate one will\ndepend on whether the expert system is designed to produce a final result i.e., a diagnosis\nor course of action, or if it begins with a known conclusion i.e., goal.\n▪ If the process starts with a set of conditions and chaining moves towards a final conclusion,\nthis is called forward chaining.\n▪ If the process starts with a known conclusion, but the path to it is unknown, the chaining is\ncalled backward chaining.",

    "content": "Tips for Designing a PID Controllers\n1. Obtain an open-loop response and determine what needs to be improved.\n2. Add a proportional control to improve the rise time .\n3. Add a derivative control to improve the overshoot.\n4. Add an integral control to eliminate the steady-state error.\n5. Adjust each of K , K , and K until you obtain a desired overall response.\np i d\n• Lastly, please keep in mind that you do not need to implement all three controllers\n(proportional, derivative, and integral) into a single system, if not necessary. For example, if\na PI controller gives a good enough response, then you don't need to implement derivative\ncontroller to the system. Keep the controller as simple as possible.\n\nStability of the Control System\nTransfer functions can usually be expressed as the ratio of two polynomials in the complex variable, s as\n𝑚 𝑚−1\n𝑌(𝑠) 𝑏 𝑠 + 𝑏 𝑠 + ⋯ + 𝑏 𝑠 + 𝑏\n0 1 𝑚−1 𝑚\n𝐺 𝑠 = = (𝑛 ≥ 𝑚)\n𝑋(𝑠) 𝑎 𝑠𝑛 + 𝑎 𝑠𝑛−1 + ⋯ + 𝑎 𝑠 + 𝑎\n0 1 𝑛−1 𝑛\n▪ When order of the denominator polynomial is greater than the numerator polynomial the transfer\nfunction is said to be ‘proper’.\n▪ Otherwise ‘Improper’.\n▪ Transfer function helps us to check the stability of the control system.\n\nStability of the Control System\nTransfer functions can usually be expressed as the ratio of two polynomials in the complex variable, s as\n𝑚 𝑚−1\n𝑌(𝑠) 𝑏 𝑠 + 𝑏 𝑠 + ⋯ + 𝑏 𝑠 + 𝑏\n0 1 𝑚−1 𝑚\n𝐺 𝑠 = = (𝑛 ≥ 𝑚)\n𝑋(𝑠) 𝑎 𝑠𝑛 + 𝑎 𝑠𝑛−1 + ⋯ + 𝑎 𝑠 + 𝑎\n0 1 𝑛−1 𝑛\nZeros: Zeros of a Transfer function are the frequencies (value of s) for which the numerator of the Transfer\nFunction becomes zero.
